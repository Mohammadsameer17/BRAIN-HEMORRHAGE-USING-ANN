# BRAIN-HEMORRHAGE-USING-ANN

This is my Machine Learning project. The aim of brain hemorrhage detection using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is to develop a computational model that can accurately identify and classify cases of brain hemorrhage from medical imaging data such as CT scans or MRI images. It shows the exact region of masking, where the exact region is Fast and efficient detection of brain hemorrhage In fraction of seconds, we can process many scans. It show the proper accuracy and exact result
